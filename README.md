# Caesar Cipher 🔐

A Python project that implements the classic Caesar cipher.  
This program allows you to **encode** and **decode** messages by shifting letters through the alphabet.  
It includes input validation, looping for multiple runs, and an ASCII art logo for a polished user experience.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Applying modular arithmetic (`%`) to wrap shifts around the alphabet
- Using string methods like `.lower()` and `.isupper()` to normalize and preserve input
- Validating user input with loops and `try/except` to prevent crashes
- Structuring a reusable function (`caesar()`) for both encoding and decoding
- Designing a clean program loop with restart logic and friendly error handling

## 🚀 How to Play
Run `main.py` in a Python environment and follow the prompts:

## 📁 Files
- `main.py`: Main game logic
- `art.py`: Contains ASCII art logo

## 📚 Credits
